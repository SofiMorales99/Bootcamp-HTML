                <h2>Javascripts Basics</h2>
                <h3>Javascript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. 
                JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons, It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a buch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server),
                it can be connected to the objects of these enviroments to provide programmable control over them.</h3>

                    <li>
                        <p><a href="">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values- imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers.<span> var x; </span></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>  
                        <p><a href="">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, givin our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.<span> var x = 10;</span></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><a href="">Data Types</a> Data types are important concept;
                            to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type.
                            There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span>true</span> or <span>false</span>; 
                            null - <span>null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span>42</span> or <span>3.14159;</span> 
                            String - <span>"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> 
                            Array - <span>[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</span> and O
                            bject - <span>{first_name:'Jane',las_name:'Doe'}</span></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><a href="">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - 
                            hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. 
                            There are the following conditional statements: <span>if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span>else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span>else</span> we execute this block of code;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><a href="">Loops</a>There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: 
                            they will repeat an action some number of times. 
                            Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. 
                            Thats a loop!</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><a href="">Functions</a>Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. 
                            Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, 
                            first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. 
                            Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over again.</p>
